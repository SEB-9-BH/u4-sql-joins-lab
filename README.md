## About

In this lab, you will practice applying SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables. Working with a movies database, you will join tables containing directors, movies, and users who “favorite” those movies. For each exercise, you will write a query to retrieve results from joined data.

By the end of this lab, you should have a deeper understanding of one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and how to pull meaningful data from a relational database using SQL joins.
